<h2>What are you hearing?</h2>
<div id="container" class="container">
    <p>This graph shows all the messages being said in all group chats that you are a part of. Circles are sized based
        on frequency, the most its said the bigger the circle and the stronger the forces. Feel free to pan and zoom
        around. The animation will stop after 60 seconds to keep the speed of the page up! Any words said less than 100
        times will be hidden, otherwise you get crazy amounts of values</p>

<h2>Who are you talking to?</h2>
<div class="container">
    <p>Not a sign of going crazy this time, this graph shows you connections between you and everyone in group chats.
        Anyone in a group together has a link placed between them. This graph will lag a fair amount but will stop
        moving after 60 seconds. </p>

<h2>What am I saying?</h2>
<div class="container">
    <p>Ever feel like you lose your train of thought right in the middle of... anyway this graph shows what words just
        you are saying! This follows the same rules as What are you hearing but only for your own words this time. Think
        of this as the more narcissistic version of that chart</p>

<h2>What am I sending?</h2>
<div class="container">
    <p>Like an overworked postman, you're messages carry a lot of stuff. This graph shows what you're sending in each
        group chat. Circles are sized by the proportion of messages sent in each chat. You can hover over each circle to
        see the group that it is a part of and answer the clearly most important question, who's getting the most
        gifs?</p>

<h2>What do I like?</h2>
<div class="container">
    <p>We all love advertisers and their definitely not creepy intent to learn as much about you as possible. So here
        are the things that facebook thinks you like in your adverts! See if you can spot any similarities to the ads
        you see. Because this is definitely all the info they have... absolutely...</p>
</div>
<div id="ads"></div>

<h2>Who's got my data?</h2>
<div class="container">
    <p>It turns out that other apps link with facebook to link in all your data. This chart gives you a list of apps
        which produce events linked into your facebook account. Bubble size indicates the amount of events they have
        recorded with Facebook. Think of it like following you but more digital and acceptable</p>
